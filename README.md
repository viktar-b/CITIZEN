# CITIZEN

The national lottery posts the historical results of the national lottery in csv format. You can download it [here](https://www.national-lottery.co.uk/results/lotto/draw-history)

Once you've downloaded the file I want you to read the file and count every number that is shown. I want you to then to then print out the 6 most frequent numbers together.

I want to see you to make sure you check for any edge cases when parsing the data.
